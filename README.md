# Text-games Benchmark
This repository contains the files needed to benchmark language agents on text-based games.

## Getting Started
1.	Make a dedicted conda virtual environment.

        conda create -n tw-bench python=3.10
        conda activate tw-bench

2.	Install the required packages (Jericho, TextWorld, ScienceWorld, DiscoveryWorld, ALFWorld).

        pip install -r requirements.txt

3.	Run benchmark evaluation on all the games for the specified random agent:

        python benchmark.py --agent agents/random.py:RandomAgent

4.	Run benchmark evaluation on a subset of the games:

        python benchmark.py --env tw-cooking --agent agents/random.py:RandomAgent

5.	Run benchmark evaluation on specific games:

        python benchmark.py --envs JerichoEnvZork1 JerichoEnvDetective --agent agents/random.py:RandomAgent

6.	Run benchmark evaluation using as a HumanAgent:

        python benchmark.py --envs TWCookingLevel1 --agent agents/human.py:HumanAgent


## Benchmarking LLMs

In order to benchmark a given LLM acting as language agent playing text-based games, you will need to first configure it. `tw-bench` is leveraging the [`llm`](https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/) library to handle communication with different LLMs.

    python benchmark.py --envs TWCookingLevel1 --agent agents/llm.py:LLMAgent

### API-based LLMS

`llm` natively supports OpenAI models.

### Adding support to other LLMS

    llm install llm-azure


## Custom Agents

To build a custom agent, you need to create a new file (e.g., `custom.py`) in the agents folder and implement the `Agent` class.

```python
from typing import Dict, Any
import twbench

class CustomAgent(twbench.Agent):

    def act(self, obs: str, reward: float, done: bool, infos: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
        # ...
        return "help"
```

You can then use this agent by specifying the path to the file and the class name in the `--agent` argument.

        python benchmark.py --agent agents/custom.py:CustomAgent
