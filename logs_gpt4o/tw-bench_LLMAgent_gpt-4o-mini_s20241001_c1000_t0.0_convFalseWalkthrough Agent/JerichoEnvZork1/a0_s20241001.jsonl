A table seems to have been used recently for the preparation of food. A passage leads to the west and a dark staircase can be seen leading upward. A dark chimney leads down and to the east is a small window which is open.\nOn the table is an elongated brown sack, smelling of hot peppers.\nA bottle is sitting on the table.\nThe glass bottle contains:\n  A quantity of water\n\n\nOpen sack\n\nOpening the brown sack reveals a lunch, and a clove of garlic.\n\n\nGet garlic\n\nTaken.\n\n\nW\n\nLiving Room\nYou are in the living room.

On the west is the bottom of a steep metal ramp which is unclimbable.\n\n\nN\n\nThe Troll Room\nThis is a small room with passages to the east and south and a forbidding hole leading west.

The path heads north-south here. One particularly large tree with some low branches stands at the edge of the path.\n\n\nU\n\nUp a Tree\nYou are about 10 feet above the ground nestled among some large branches. The nearest branch above you is above your reach.\nBeside you on the branch is a small bird's nest.\nIn the bird's nest is a large egg encrusted with precious jewels, apparently scavenged by a childless songbird. The egg is covered with fine gold inlay, and ornamented in lapis lazuli and mother-of-pearl. Unlike most eggs, this one is hinged and closed with a delicate looking clasp. The egg appears extremely fragile.\n\n\nGet egg\n\nTaken.\n\n\nD\n\nForest Path\nYou hear in the distance the chirping of a song bird.\n\n\nS\n\nNorth of House\n\n\nE\n\nBehind House\nYou are behind the white house. A path leads into the forest to the east. In one corner of the house there is a small window which is slightly ajar.\n\n\nOpen window\n\nWith great effort, you open the window far enough to allow entry.\n\n\nW\n\nKitchen\nYou are in the kitchen of the white house. A table seems to have been used recently for the preparation of food. A passage leads to the west and a dark staircase can be seen leading upward. A dark chimney leads down and to the east is a small window which is open.\nOn the table is an elongated brown sack, smelling of hot peppers.\nA bottle is sitting on the table.\nThe glass bottle contains:\n  A quantity of water\n\n\nOpen sack\n\nOpening the brown sack reveals a lunch, and a clove of garlic.\n\n\nGet garlic\n\nTaken.\n\n\nW\n\nLiving Room\nYou are in the living room. There is a doorway to the east, a wooden door with strange gothic lettering to the west, which appears to be nailed shut, a trophy case, and a large oriental rug in the center of the room.\nAbove the trophy case hangs an elvish sword of great antiquity.\nA battery-powered brass lantern is on the trophy case.\n\n\nGet lamp\n\nTaken.\n\n\nE\n\nKitchen\nA bottle is sitting on the table.\nThe glass bottle contains:\n  A quantity of water\nThere is a brown sack here.\nThe brown sack contains:\n  A lunch\n\n\nU\n\nYou have moved into a dark place.\nIt is pitch black.

You are likely to be eaten by a grue.\nYour sword is glowing with a faint blue glow.\n\n\nLight lamp\n\nThe brass lantern is now on.\n\nCellar\nYou are in a dark and damp cellar with a narrow passageway leading north, and a crawlway to the south. On the west is the bottom of a steep metal ramp which is unclimbable.\n\n\nN\n\nThe Troll Room\nThis is a small room with passages to the east and south and a forbidding hole leading west. Bloodstains and deep scratches (perhaps made by an axe) mar the walls.\nA nasty-looking troll, brandishing a bloody axe, blocks all passages out of the room.\nYour sword has begun to glow very brightly.\nThe axe sweeps past as you jump aside.\n\n\nKill troll with sword\n\nA quick stroke, but the troll is on guard.\nThe axe gets you right in the side.

I'm afraid you are dead.\n \n   ****  You have died  **** \n\nNow, let's take a look here... Well, you probably deserve another chance. I can't quite fix you up completely, but you can't have everything.\n\nForest\nThis is a forest, with trees in all directions.

The path heads north-south here.

The nearest branch above you is above your reach.\nBeside you on the branch is a small bird's nest.\nIn the bird's nest is a large egg encrusted with precious jewels, apparently scavenged by a childless songbird. The egg is covered with fine gold inlay, and ornamented in lapis lazuli and mother-of-pearl. Unlike most eggs, this one is hinged and closed with a delicate looking clasp.

In one corner of the house there is a small window which is slightly ajar.\n\n\nOpen window\n\nWith great effort, you open the window far enough to allow entry.\n\n\nW\n\nKitchen\nYou are in the kitchen of the white house. A table seems to have been used recently for the preparation of food. A passage leads to the west and a dark staircase can be seen leading upward. A dark chimney leads down and to the east is a small window which is open.\nOn the table is an elongated brown sack, smelling of hot peppers.\nA bottle is sitting on the table.\nThe glass bottle contains:\n  A quantity of water\n\n\nOpen sack\n\nOpening the brown sack reveals a lunch, and a clove of garlic.\n\n\nGet garlic\n\nTaken.\n\n\nW\n\nLiving Room\nYou are in the living room. There is a doorway to the east, a wooden door with strange gothic lettering to the west, which appears to be nailed shut, a trophy case, and a large oriental rug in the center of the room.\nAbove the trophy case hangs an elvish sword of great antiquity.\nA battery-powered brass lantern is on the trophy case.\n\n\nGet lamp\n\nTaken.\n\n\nE\n\nKitchen\nA bottle is sitting on the table.\nThe glass bottle contains:\n  A quantity of water\nThere is a brown sack here.\nThe brown sack contains:\n  A lunch\n\n\nU\n\nYou have moved into a dark place.\nIt is pitch black.

You are likely to be eaten by a grue.\nYour sword is glowing with a faint blue glow.\n\n\nLight lamp\n\nThe brass lantern is now on.\n\nCellar\nYou are in a dark and damp cellar with a narrow passageway leading north, and a crawlway to the south. On the west is the bottom of a steep metal ramp which is unclimbable.\n\n\nN\n\nThe Troll Room\nThis is a small room with passages to the east and south and a forbidding hole leading west. Bloodstains and deep scratches (perhaps made by an axe) mar the walls.\nA nasty-looking troll, brandishing a bloody axe, blocks all passages out of the room.\nYour sword has begun to glow very brightly.\nThe axe sweeps past as you jump aside.\n\n\nKill troll with sword\n\nA quick stroke, but the troll is on guard.\nThe axe gets you right in the side.

The egg is covered with fine gold inlay, and ornamented in lapis lazuli and mother-of-pearl. Unlike most eggs, this one is hinged and closed with a delicate looking clasp.

On the west is the bottom of a steep metal ramp which is unclimbable.\n\n\nN\n\nThe Troll Room\nThis is a small room with passages to the east and south and a forbidding hole leading west. Bloodstains and deep scratches (perhaps made by an axe) mar the walls.\nA nasty-looking troll, brandishing a bloody axe, blocks all passages out of the room.\nYour sword has begun to glow very brightly.\nThe axe sweeps past as you jump aside.\n\n\nKill troll with sword\n\nA quick stroke, but the troll is on guard.\nThe axe gets you right in the side.

The path heads north-south here. One particularly large tree with some low branches stands at the edge of the path.\n\n\nU\n\nUp a Tree\nYou are about 10 feet above the ground nestled among some large branches. The nearest branch above you is above your reach.\nBeside you on the branch is a small bird's nest.\nIn the bird's nest is a large egg encrusted with precious jewels, apparently scavenged by a childless songbird. The egg is covered with fine gold inlay, and ornamented in lapis lazuli and mother-of-pearl. Unlike most eggs, this one is hinged and closed with a delicate looking clasp.

In one corner of the house there is a small window which is slightly ajar.\n\n\nOpen window\n\nWith great effort, you open the window far enough to allow entry.\n\n\nW\n\nKitchen\nYou are in the kitchen of the white house. A table seems to have been used recently for the preparation of food. A passage leads to the west and a dark staircase can be seen leading upward. A dark chimney leads down and to the east is a small window which is open.\nOn the table is an elongated brown sack, smelling of hot peppers.\nA bottle is sitting on the table.\nThe glass bottle contains:\n  A quantity of water\n\n\nOpen sack\n\nOpening the brown sack reveals a lunch, and a clove of garlic.\n\n\nGet garlic\n\nTaken.\n\n\nW\n\nLiving Room\nYou are in the living room.

You are likely to be eaten by a grue.\nYour sword is glowing with a faint blue glow.\n\n\nLight lamp\n\nThe brass lantern is now on.\n\nCellar\nYou are in a dark and damp cellar with a narrow passageway leading north, and a crawlway to the south. On the west is the bottom of a steep metal ramp which is unclimbable.\n\n\nN\n\nThe Troll Room\nThis is a small room with passages to the east and south and a forbidding hole leading west. Bloodstains and deep scratches (perhaps made by an axe) mar the walls.\nA nasty-looking troll, brandishing a bloody axe, blocks all passages out of the room.\nYour sword has begun to glow very brightly.\nThe axe sweeps past as you jump aside.\n\n\nKill troll with sword\n\nA quick stroke, but the troll is on guard.\nThe axe gets you right in the side.

The nearest branch above you is above your reach.\nBeside you on the branch is a small bird's nest.\nIn the bird's nest is a large egg encrusted with precious jewels, apparently scavenged by a childless songbird. The egg is covered with fine gold inlay, and ornamented in lapis lazuli and mother-of-pearl. Unlike most eggs, this one is hinged and closed with a delicate looking clasp.

You are likely to be eaten by a grue.\nYour sword is glowing with a faint blue glow.\n\n\nLight lamp\n\nThe brass lantern is now on.\n\nCellar\nYou are in a dark and damp cellar with a narrow passageway leading north, and a crawlway to the south. On the west is the bottom of a steep metal ramp which is unclimbable.\n\n\nN\n\nThe Troll Room\nThis is a small room with passages to the east and south and a forbidding hole leading west. Bloodstains and deep scratches (perhaps made by an axe) mar the walls.\nA nasty-looking troll, brandishing a bloody axe, blocks all passages out of the room.\nYour sword has begun to glow very brightly.\nThe axe sweeps past as you jump aside.\n\n\nKill troll with sword\n\nA quick stroke, but the troll is on guard.\nThe axe gets you right in the side.

The egg is covered with fine gold inlay, and ornamented in lapis lazuli and mother-of-pearl. Unlike most eggs, this one is hinged and closed with a delicate looking clasp.

On the west is the bottom of a steep metal ramp which is unclimbable.\n\n\nN\n\nThe Troll Room\nThis is a small room with passages to the east and south and a forbidding hole leading west. Bloodstains and deep scratches (perhaps made by an axe) mar the walls.\nA nasty-looking troll, brandishing a bloody axe, blocks all passages out of the room.\nYour sword has begun to glow very brightly.\nThe axe sweeps past as you jump aside.\n\n\nKill troll with sword\n\nA quick stroke, but the troll is on guard.\nThe axe gets you right in the side.

The nearest branch above you is above your reach.\nBeside you on the branch is a small bird's nest.\nIn the bird's nest is a large egg encrusted with precious jewels, apparently scavenged by a childless songbird. The egg is covered with fine gold inlay, and ornamented in lapis lazuli and mother-of-pearl. Unlike most eggs, this one is hinged and closed with a delicate looking clasp.

On the west is the bottom of a steep metal ramp which is unclimbable.\n\n\nN\n\nThe Troll Room\nThis is a small room with passages to the east and south and a forbidding hole leading west. Bloodstains and deep scratches (perhaps made by an axe) mar the walls.\nA nasty-looking troll, brandishing a bloody axe, blocks all passages out of the room.\nYour sword has begun to glow very brightly.\nThe axe sweeps past as you jump aside.\n\n\nKill troll with sword\n\nA quick stroke, but the troll is on guard.\nThe axe gets you right in the side.

On the west is the bottom of a steep metal ramp which is unclimbable.\n\n\nN\n\nThe Troll Room\nThis is a small room with passages to the east and south and a forbidding hole leading west. Bloodstains and deep scratches (perhaps made by an axe) mar the walls.\nA nasty-looking troll, brandishing a bloody axe, blocks all passages out of the room.\nYour sword has begun to glow very brightly.\nThe axe sweeps past as you jump aside.\n\n\nKill troll with sword\n\nA quick stroke, but the troll is on guard.\nThe axe gets you right in the side.

I'm afraid you are dead.\n \n   ****  You have died  **** \n\nNow, let's take a look here... Well, you probably deserve another chance. I can't quite fix you up completely, but you can't have everything.\n\nForest\nThis is a forest, with trees in all directions.

There is no door here, and all the windows are boarded up. To the north a narrow path winds through the trees.\n\n\nN\n\nForest Path\nThis is a path winding through a dimly lit forest. The path heads north-south here. One particularly large tree with some low branches stands at the edge of the path.\n\n\nU\n\nUp a Tree\nYou are about 10 feet above the ground nestled among some large branches. The nearest branch above you is above your reach.\nBeside you on the branch is a small bird's nest.\nIn the bird's nest is a large egg encrusted with precious jewels, apparently scavenged by a childless songbird. The egg is covered with fine gold inlay, and ornamented in lapis lazuli and mother-of-pearl. Unlike most eggs, this one is hinged and closed with a delicate looking clasp. The egg appears extremely fragile.\n\n\nGet egg\n\nTaken.\n\n\nD\n\nForest Path\nYou hear in the distance the chirping of a song bird.\n\n\nS\n\nNorth of House\n\n\nE\n\nBehind House\nYou are behind the white house. A path leads into the forest to the east. In one corner of the house there is a small window which is slightly ajar.\n\n\nOpen window\n\nWith great effort, you open the window far enough to allow entry.\n\n\nW\n\nKitchen\nYou are in the kitchen of the white house. A table seems to have been used recently for the preparation of food. A passage leads to the west and a dark staircase can be seen leading upward. A dark chimney leads down and to the east is a small window which is open.\nOn the table is an elongated brown sack, smelling of hot peppers.\nA bottle is sitting on the table.\nThe glass bottle contains:\n  A quantity of water\n\n\nOpen sack\n\nOpening the brown sack reveals a lunch, and a clove of garlic.\n\n\nGet garlic\n\nTaken.\n\n\nW\n\nLiving Room\nYou are in the living room. There is a doorway to the east, a wooden door with strange gothic lettering to the west, which appears to be nailed shut, a trophy case, and a large oriental rug in the center of the room.\nAbove the trophy case hangs an elvish sword of great antiquity.\nA battery-powered brass lantern is on the trophy case.\n\n\nGet lamp\n\nTaken.\n\n\nE\n\nKitchen\nA bottle is sitting on the table.\nThe glass bottle contains:\n  A quantity of water\nThere is a brown sack here.\nThe brown sack contains:\n  A lunch\n\n\nU\n\nYou have moved into a dark place.\nIt is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.\n\n\nLight lamp\n\nThe brass lantern is now on.\n\nAttic\nThis is the attic. The only exit is a stairway leading down.\nA large coil of rope is lying in the corner.\nOn a table is a nasty-looking knife.\n\n\nGet rope\n\nTaken.\n\n\nGet knife\n\nTaken.\n\n\nD\n\nKitchen\nA bottle is sitting on the table.\nThe glass bottle contains:\n  A quantity of water\nThere is a brown sack here.\nThe brown sack contains:\n  A lunch\n\n\nDouse lamp\n\nThe brass lantern is now off.\n\n\nW\n\nLiving Room\nAbove the trophy case hangs an elvish sword of great antiquity.\n\n\nGet sword\n\nTaken.\n\n\nMove rug\n\nWith a great effort, the rug is moved to one side of the room, revealing the dusty cover of a closed trap door.\n\n\nOpen trapdoor\n\nThe door reluctantly opens to reveal a rickety staircase descending into darkness.\n\n\nD\n\nYou have moved into a dark place.\nThe trap door crashes shut, and you hear someone barring it.\n\nIt is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.\nYour sword is glowing with a faint blue glow.\n\n\nLight lamp\n\nThe brass lantern is now on.\n\nCellar\nYou are in a dark and damp cellar with a narrow passageway leading north, and a crawlway to the south. On the west is the bottom of a steep metal ramp which is unclimbable.\n\n\nN\n\nThe Troll Room\nThis is a small room with passages to the east and south and a forbidding hole leading west. Bloodstains and deep scratches (perhaps made by an axe) mar the walls.\nA nasty-looking troll, brandishing a bloody axe, blocks all passages out of the room.\nYour sword has begun to glow very brightly.\nThe axe sweeps past as you jump aside.\n\n\nKill troll with sword\n\nA quick stroke, but the troll is on guard.\nThe axe gets you right in the side. Ouch!\n\n\ndrop egg\n\nDropped.\nYou stagger back under a hail of axe strokes.\n\n\nE\n\nThe troll fends you off with a menacing gesture.\nThe axe sweeps past as you jump aside.\n\n\nE\n\nThe troll fends you off with a menacing gesture.\nThe axe sweeps past as you jump aside.\n\n\nE\n\nThe troll fends you off with a menacing gesture.\nThe flat of the troll's axe hits you delicately on the head, knocking you out.\nConquering his fears, the troll puts you to death.\nIt appears that that last blow was too much for you. I'm afraid you are dead.\n \n   ****  You have died  **** \n\nNow, let's take a look here... Well, you probably deserve another chance. I can't quite fix you up completely, but you can't have everything.\n\nForest\nThis is a forest, with trees in all directions. To the east, there appears to be sunlight.\n\n\n\n-= Restarting =-\nCopyright (c) 1981, 1982, 1983 Infocom, Inc.
